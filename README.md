# Bulk-PDFtoCBR
Simple python script to bulk convert PDFs to CBR. Built for personal use, but uploaded here in case someone else needs it.

## Usage
Download the .py file and copy it into a folder with the PDFs you want to convert. The script won't look for PDFs into subdirectories, but only into the current dir.
Open the terminal and run the script. No configuration needed.
The script will also convert all CBZ to CBR for consistency.

## Dependencies
[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) needs to be installed.
